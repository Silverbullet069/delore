22.{"id": "CWE-732", "name": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "description": "The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors."}

23.{"id": "CWE-611", "name": "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "description": "The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output."}
