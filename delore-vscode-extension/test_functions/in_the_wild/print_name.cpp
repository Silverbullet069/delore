// Vulnerabilities Detected:
// 1. Lack of input validation - The scanf() function does not validate user input, which could lead to a buffer overflow attack.
// 2. Unknown input validation: The Sanitize() function's implementation is unknown, which could lead to a SQL injection attack if poor implementation.
